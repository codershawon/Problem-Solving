<!-- Topics -->

1. Data Structures=>

   - Arrays:  
     => A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
   - Strings:
     => A string is a sequence of characters, used to represent information.
   - Linked Lists:
     => A collection of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
   - Stacks:
     => A stack is a linear structure that follows a last in first out (LIFO) principle.
   - Queues:
     => A queue is a linear collection of elements ordered according to the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle.
   - Trees:
     => A hierarchical structure where each node contains data and references to its children nodes.
   - Graphs:
     => A collection of nodes connected by directed edges.

2. Algorithms =>
   - Sorting:
     => Arranging data in ascending or descending order.
   - Searching:
    => Finding a specific element within a dataset.
   - Recursion:
    => A process that calls itself to perform some task.
   - Dynamic Programming:
    => A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler problems, and then building up each solution step-by-step until the final solution is reached.
